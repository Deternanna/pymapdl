**You must use this Codespace only for developing, contributing, documenting, and
writing examples for PyMAPDL**.

Additionally, this Codespace is using an MAPDL Student version. For information on how Ansys
supports your learning Ansys software, see the
`Ansys for Students <https://www.ansys.com/academic/students>`_ page on the Ansys website.
The Ansys Student version has some limitations. For more information, see the

üìñ Codespace configuration
==========================

This Codespace has been set for helping developers explore and experiment with
PyMAPDL in the easiest way. It contains all the OS and Python dependencies
for running PyMAPDL notebooks and do changes in the code.
The libraries needed for testing or building the documentation are not included,
however you can install them using:

.. code:: terminal

    cd pymapdl
    pip install -e '.[tests]'  # to install testing libraries
    pip install -e '.[doc]'  # to install libraries needed for building the documentation
    pip install -e '.[doc,tests]'  # to install both


Some of the available Python dependencies are:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* PyVista
* Plotly
